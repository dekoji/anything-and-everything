# User Experience

The goal of **Task Queue** is to add tasks and automatically schedule time blocks to complete tasks as appropriate.

## Design Considerations

### Task 

A task should contain the following set of information

1. Estimated time to complete
2. Due Date
3. Importance

Some tasks don't have a specified due date, but they can still have rank importance over one another.
When all tasks with due dates are completed, then ones without due dates can be displayed.

## Task Queue Prioritization

At any given point in time, 3 to 5 tasks should be displayed in priority order.

Factors that can affect the priority of tasks
- Due Date
- Importance
- Time Slot
- Mood (feeling an easy or hard task)
